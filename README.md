* Are you ready to start adapting? This wiki page helps you to [get started!](../../../climada/wiki/Getting-started)  
* Read more on [natural catastrophe modelling](../../../climada/wiki/NatCat-modelling) and look at the GUI that we have prepared for you.
* Read the [core ***climada*** manual (PDF)](../../../climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf?raw=true).

#####climada_module_barisal_demo

Barisal, Bangladesh, demo module for tropical cyclone - really just a demo, all numbers and results are for demonstration purposes only.

This module contains the additional climada module to implement a demo tropical cyclone hazard event set for Barisal in Bangladesh.

Please install climada core first, see https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada

In order to grant core climada access to additional modules, create a folder 'modules' in the core climada folder and copy/move any additional modules into climada/modules, without 'climada_module_' in the filename. 

E.g. if the addition module is named climada_module_MODULE_NAME, we should have
.../climada the core climada, with sub-folders as
.../climada/code
.../climada/data
.../climada/docs
and then
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME with contents such as 
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/code
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/data
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/docs
this way, climada sources all modules' code upon startup

see [climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf](../../../climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf?raw=true) to get started
