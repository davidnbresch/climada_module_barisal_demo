#####climada_module_barisal_demo

Barisal, Bangladesh, demo module for tropical cyclone - really just a demo, all numbers and results are for demonstration purposes only.

This module contains the additional climada module to implement a demo tropical cyclone hazard event set for Barisal in Bangladesh.

Please install climada core first, see https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada

In order to grant core climada access to additional modules, create a folder 'modules' in the core climada folder and copy/move any additional modules into climada/modules, without 'climada_module_' in the filename. 

E.g. if the addition module is named climada_module_MODULE_NAME, we should have  
.../climada the core climada, with sub-folders as  
.../climada/code  
.../climada/data  
.../climada/docs  
and then  
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME with contents such as   
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/code  
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/data  
.../climada/modules/MODULE_NAME/docs  
this way, climada sources all modules' code upon startup

See [climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf](../../../climada/docs/climada_manual.pdf?raw=true) to get started.
